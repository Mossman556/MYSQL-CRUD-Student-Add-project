Title: Student Record Management System

# Description:

This Student Record Management System is a simple yet efficient desktop application developed using C# and MySQL. 
The primary goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use interface for managing student records. 
It is well-suited for schools, colleges, or other educational institutions looking to streamline their record-keeping processes.


# Features:

* Add New Student: Users can add new students to the database by entering essential information such as Name, Registration Number, Class, and Section.

* Update Student Records: The system allows users to edit existing student records, making it convenient to keep information up-to-date.

* Delete Student Records: Users can remove student records from the database when necessary.

* View All Students: The application provides an organized view of all student records in a DataGridView, making it easy to browse and locate specific records.

* Search Functionality: Users can search for specific students using the search bar, making it quick and easy to find and access the required information.

* MySQL Database Integration: The system is backed by a MySQL database, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of student records. The application supports local database setup via XAMPP or a remote MySQL server.

IMPORTANT: Please note that this project is designed for educational purposes and should not be used in a production environment without proper security measures and optimizations.


# Usage

If you want to Test this Student Record Management System there is an exe file in Output folder and you also need to install XAMPP. I put couple of pictures on how to setup the MYSQL Database. Basically just add new database called student and then new table called studen_table and add the columns in the picture. Pictures can be found in pictures folder.
